Hello


  This is my first blog post on GitHub.

What I'm aiming to do here on is write articles about my projects and hacks that I've learned over the many years(I'm 20 as of 2016).

Hopefully I'll write DIYs, How-Tos and many other things that I'm working on.

The reason I'm doing this is to document everything I'm working on and re-evaluate what I've done to get a better understanding.

Check out my [GitHub](http://github.com/parasitecruuncher) for my project repos.
